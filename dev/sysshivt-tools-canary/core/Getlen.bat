REM The algorithm of this program repeats for loop only 13 times for each call from the main batch file...

REM It makes it fast and efficient for calculating the length of longer strings...
REM  It can calculate upto 8100 aprox. characters...

REM Get More Extensions Like this @ https://batchprogrammers.blogspot.com

REM It is an upgrade to the older getlen.exe function, which was created using cpp's getlen function...
