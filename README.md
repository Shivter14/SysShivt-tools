# Welcome to the official SysShivt tools download server.
## What is SysShivt tools?
SysShivt tools is an advanced operating system running in Windows Command Prompt (CMD) using Batch files. It started in 30.8.2021, and it still hasn't reached it's full potential, since I (Shivter) am the only one working on it.
## Why are all the versions in zip files?
That is becose SysShivt tools uses this repository as a download server so it can detect updates and automatically install them. (It's really cool considering it's all done by batch files)
