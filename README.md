# Welcome to the official SysShivt tools Archive. 
### What is _SysShivt tools_?

SysShivt tools used to be an operating system running in CMD using Batch files.

It started in 30.8.2021, and this project is currently *being ended*, with the successor being ![Shivtanium](https://github.com/Shivter14/Shivtanium).

# Why are all the versions in zip files?
That is because SysShivt tools uses this repository as a download server so that it can detect updates and automatically install them to this day.
